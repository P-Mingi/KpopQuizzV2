# Requests of lane Q0a

1. To ORCH, `scripts/o1/gate.sh` (owner ORCH). For lane Q0a only, run the lane's own harness from the gate worktree:
   `$WT/scripts/o1/gate-checks.sh` instead of `$O1/scripts/o1/gate-checks.sh` (which exists only after Q0a merges).
   Why: the done test "gate-checks.sh runs on a gate worktree with the three site builds and writes one log per
   check" can then be proven by the gate's own evidence, the only evidence R accepts. Q0a's diff stays in the
   neutral folders, so the gate builds kpop, anime and hub itself and parity is skipped.
2. To ORCH, `scripts/o1/gate.sh`. When the gate calls parity (`touches_kpop`), pass `--keep`, and hand the kept head
   build (`ROOT/.claude/worktrees/o1-parity-head/apps/quiz/.next` and `KPQ/cache/parity/<key>/freeze`) to
   gate-checks.sh for the kpop checks; the next parity run removes the kept worktrees. Why: the brief asks gate.sh
   to skip its own kpop build when parity runs, and an offline kpop build has no data for check:orphans and
   check:indexability. Exact interface comes with gate-checks.sh (next slices); this item is the heads-up.
3. To ORCH, `scripts/o1/gate.sh`, optional. Build kpop with `NEXT_PUBLIC_BT_TRACKING=1` too: production runs with it
   (`docs/design/growth-v12/run/LAUNCH-REPORT.md` step 2). parity.sh now sets it.
4. To F0 and B6, through ORCH (contract note). The client wrapper that gives `<Analytics />` its `beforeSend` must
   be a named export `NetAnalytics`. Why: the G0 normalisation N2 (`scripts/o1/parity/compare.mjs`) recognises the
   client reference of `Analytics` and `NetAnalytics` only; a default export would appear as `"default"` and keep the
   page DIFFERENT.
5. To B1, through ORCH (contract note). For N1, declare `--ux-on-accent` with a white value (`#fff` or `#ffffff`) in
   the served UX stylesheet and replace `color: #fff` by `color: var(--ux-on-accent)` (no fallback form
   `var(--ux-on-accent, #fff)`). Any other change to the served CSS keeps the `?v=` difference, so parity fails.
